# Manufacturing OEE Analysis & Downtime Optimisation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analysing Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) within a simulated high-volume manufacturing environment. Using structured downtime data, performance losses were identified and improvement opportunities were evaluated.

The objective was to demonstrate data-driven manufacturing optimisation techniques aligned with Industry 4.0 principles.
